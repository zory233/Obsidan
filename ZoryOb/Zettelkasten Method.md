# In short
>  When creating a personal knowledge management system, you ultimately develop a system and structure for organizing your ideas, thoughts, and information in a way that suits your thinking. In a way, you develop a web of knowledge and build up a “second brain” of all the information that you collect to help fuel an emergent approach of thinking.
>  
>  In short, a Zettelkasten is simply a framework to help organize your ideas, thoughts, and information. By relating pieces of knowledge and connecting information to each other (by way of hyperlinking), you are replicating a train of thought. By establishing relationships between pieces of knowledge, you are helping retain consumed information allowing your thinking process to grow organically.
>  
>  The main point is to write your notes in such a way that you will easily be able to quickly get the gist of the material when you come across it again.
>  
>  Note-taking or note collecting is great, but having access to a significant amount of information doesn’t make you smarter. Ask yourself questions when analyzing the information to help you develop your own ideas to the content or material. Make it a regular habit to review information in your Zettelkasten to jog your memory and encourage you to see patterns create connections between ideas and information.

# Types of notes
1. Literature Notes
	- Literature Notes are the notes you make as comments to the text you have selected or marked down.
2. Reference Notes
	- Common ways we use referencing in everyday life include the use of the hashtag (#) on social networking platforms, attributing credit when writing a thesis paper, or when adding a hyperlink to the source location of a particular referenced media file such as pictures, GIFs, or videos.
3. Permanent Notes
	- Permanent notes are stand-alone ideas that can be made without any direct context to other sourced information such as books, videos, or other available data.  
	- Permanent notes can be made as a recap or summary of the information just researched or learned, but can also be thoughts that popped into your brain while thinking over a myriad of information or while analysing any given context.
	- The aim of permanent notes is to process the notes you have made and analyze how they affect your interests, thinking, and research. You then cherry pick the notes that add value to your existing ideas and connect the new information to what you already know and have saved in your database.
4. Fleeting notes
	- Fleeting notes are unstructured and unorganized notes. They serve as temporary holders of information for later use that you will need to organize into your system. In short, fleeting notes are temporary reminders of ideas.
5. Hub notes
	- Hub notes are Zettels about a certain topic with subtopics. They are similar to the index or the table of contents. Use hubnotes as a reference or index for your work. Write down the list of topics in your Zettelkasten with a description and reference number to help you find and access information easier and quicker.

# Principles
1. write all the time and in your own words
2. everything is knowledge
3. notes are irreducible, complete thoughts
4. knowledge is interconnected
